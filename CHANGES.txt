Changelog of lizard-ui
======================


1.54 (2011-03-18)
-----------------

- Removed width: 100% css for .auto-inserted. It works fine without
  it. Before the image was slightly scaled horizontally.

- Added possibility for a double-height item in the
  divideVerticalSpaceEqually() method.  Just add a
  "double-vertical-item" class instead of "vertical-item" to the item
  you want to give double the height.


1.53 (2011-03-09)
-----------------

- Removed setUpWorkspaceAcceptableButtons. The button is now added
  when a workspace-acceptable is clicked (lizard-map 1.58 and higher).

- Adding error message when a "replace-with-image" image is loaded and
  there's an error. Instead of an ever-spinning "loading..." icon.


1.52 (2011-02-23)
-----------------

- Centered the progress animation.

- Added data-src to progress animation (for debugging purposes).


1.51 (2011-02-15)

  collapsed-for-printing view again.

- Tables now print with a grid and proper left/center/right alignment.

- Links don't print anymore (at least, their url isn't appended anymore to the
  link text when printing).


1.17 (2010-09-22)
-----------------

- Add colorpicker js library.

- Added createcoverage command.



1.16 (2010-09-08)
-----------------

- Added more tests.

- Small layout tweak for popup box.


1.15 (2010-09-03)
-----------------

- Added utility templatetags.


1.14 (2010-08-30)
-----------------

- Importing json via django now.


1.13 (2010-08-30)
-----------------

- Bugfix simplejson.


1.12 (2010-08-27)
-----------------

- Small adjustments to support lizard-map's new graph popup.  (A better
  separation of lizard-ui and lizard-map is needed later on: after the
  deadlines :-) ).


1.11 (2010-08-26)
-----------------

- Styled the login form including proper "enter" behaviour and
  first-field-gets-focus handling.


1.10 (2010-08-26)
-----------------

- Moved some css styling from lizard-map to lizard-ui.

- Added initial login support + forms.  You need to add lizard-ui's urls.py to
  yours if you want to use it.

- Better drag/drop visual feedback.


1.8 (2010-08-18)
----------------

- Javascript syntax fix: added two semicolons and removed another.


1.7 (2010-07-15)
----------------

- Make "replace-with-image" clickable by using "data-href-click"
  property.

- Add ol.forms css.


1.6 (2010-07-06)
----------------

- Image replacement looks at "use-my-size" class instead of
  use-my-width/height.

- Added javascript "printPage()" function that prints a webpage that at least
  doesn't flow over the right hand side of the physical paper page.  Printing
  uses a combination of a custom print stylesheet and blueprint's print
  stylesheet.  Printing definitively isn't perfect yet, but at least usable.
  Note: you should refresh or resize the page after printing to get the full
  width again.


1.5 (2010-07-01)
----------------

- Added generic automatic image resizing (replacing a generic "a href" with an
  image with the same src as the href and then figuring out the height/width
  and passing that along as a GET parameter and as attributes on the img tag.

- Fixed resize timer by having a global variable for it.

- Calculating hiddenStuffHeight (currently: only the date popup hidden div)
  only once: before the date popup has been opened..  Fixes the bug that you'd
  get a large empty space at the bottom of the screen.


1.4.1 (2010-06-25)
------------------

- Updated TODO list.


1.4 (2010-06-25)
----------------

- We're now on the python package index, hurray!
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui

- Updated package metadata.

- Big README documentation update.


1.3 (2010-06-23)
----------------

- Added graph reloading on sidebar collapse/expand.

- UI css fixes (overflow:hidden in a couple of places to prevent scrollbars in
  corner cases, for instance).


1.2 (2010-06-22)
----------------

- Floating the main content area now and giving it the proper width with
  javascript.  This makes the layout in IE more reliable.

- The main body has "overflow: hidden" to get rid of scrollbars once and for
  all: scrollbars sometimes occur when there's a small layout bug.  A
  scrollbar takes up space, so the main content float is pushed down.  We have
  an assumption of a single page without scrolling, so hiding scrollbars is
  perfectly fine.  (The main area itself *can* have scrollbars for textual
  content).


1.1 (2010-06-18)
----------------

- IE tweaks.


1.0 (2010-06-17)
----------------

- Fixed javascript code with jslint.

- Added django-compressor for javascript and css compression and combination.
  You'll need to add the configuration in http://dpaste.de/xLDU/ to your
  settings and add "compressor" to your installed apps.

- Switched to a separate "javascript" and "css" block instead of the
  site-head-extras, head-extras and so.  Be sure to add {{super.block}} when
  you override the blocks.


0.12 (2010-06-11)
-----------------

- Upgraded to jqueryui 1.8.2 (from 1.8.1).

- Removed jqueryui's tab component as it conflicts with jquerytools'
  implementation.  Jquerytools' implementation is way friendlier to our
  existing sidebar css.


0.11 (2010-06-08)
-----------------

- Added direct support for a jquery tree.  We already contained the base
  treeview javascript, so lizard-ui was a logical place for setting it up.


0.10 (2010-06-07)
-----------------

- Added fillSidebar() alias for stretchOneSidebarBox().

- Splitted title block in sitetitle/subtitle as that's a common occurrence.


0.9 (2010-06-03)
----------------

- Using jquery's live() for "late binding" of events to elements added later
  through javascript.  Saves some couple of lines.


0.8 (2010-06-01)
----------------

- Added generic accordion handling for the sidebar.  Including ajaxy loading.


0.7 (2010-05-18)
----------------

- Added jquerytools for accordeon behaviour in sidebar.

- Layout fixes, mostly for the sidebar.  Also fix for the datepicker-placed
  div at the bottom.

- Update to jquery-ui 1.8.1.


0.6 (2010-04-28)
----------------

- Added collapsible sidebar.

- Changed css framework from yui to blueprint: more understandable.  The
  reason for yui was that it had a 100%-width layout.  We're now building up
  the layout (grid-wise) ourselves due to the collapsible sidebar, so
  switching back to blueprint is now possible.

- Changed layout to match Dirk-Jan's latest screenshots.


0.5 (2010-04-13)
----------------

- Layout improvements.

- Added documentation (just mount our urls!).

- Removed separate icons, leaving only the sprite'd icons.

- Added jqueryui.  Including it automatically.  It also means extjs isn't
  included automatically anymore.

- Sidebar width is 300px instead of 180px.


0.4 (2010-03-16)
----------------

- Added extjs javascript library.

- Added javascript and css for dividing the vertical space equally.


0.3.1 (2010-03-05)
------------------

- Bugfix: removed sample breadcrumb content from the template.


0.3 (2010-03-05)
----------------

- Added openlayers 2.8.

- Added famfamfam silk icon set.

- Added background to menubar, footer and body.

- Removed blueprint and added the YUI css framework.


0.2 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Nested our templates in templates/lizard_ui instead of directly in
  templates.  We're well-behaved now!


0.1 (2010-02-12)
----------------

- Added lizardbase.html template as base for a lizard user interface.

- Added django-staticfiles as a dependency for managing css and javascript
  resources.

- Added blueprint css framework.

- Initial structure created by nensskel.
