Jquery ui + "smoothness" theme downloaded from http://jqueryui.com/download

Note: disable the "tabs" component as we use jquerytools' version for that as
that one fits way better with our own css styling. Just cut the Tabs part.

Later updated with version 1.8.11, including the non-minified version for
debugging purposes.

Unzip the ....custom.zip and, assuming the css hasn't really changed, copy the
following two files::

 cp development-bundle/ui/jquery-ui-1.8.11.custom.js jqueryui.js
 cp js/jquery-ui-1.8.11.custom.min.js jqueryui.min.js

All .ui-button styles have been changes to .xui-button as they conflict with
twitter-bootstrap.  [reinout]

Also, $(el).button() conflicted with bootstrap, so for jquery this is now
renamed to $(el).jqbutton(). This mainly affects lizard-riool. [ejnens]
