lizard-ui
=========

Lizard-ui provides a basic `Django <http://djangoproject.com>`_ user
interface, so a **base Django template** and some **css + javascript**.  We
designed it at `Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our
geographical information websites (with water management information).

Choices, requirements, assumptions
----------------------------------

Lizard-ui is opinionated: it makes choices and prescribes (good!)
technologies.

- Included: the `twitter-bootstrap css framework
  <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_.  It resets css styles so that
  we've got a common base.  It fixes common IE layout bugs.  It gives a basic
  typography that's quite pleasing. And it has some javascript that makes many
  common UI tasks easy.

- Required: `django-staticfiles
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-staticfiles>`_.  For a more verbose
  description, see `Reinout's blog entry
  <http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/05/19/django-css-javascript-files.html>`_
  (written with lizard-ui in mind).

- Required: `django_compressor
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_compressor>`_ for combining css/javascript
  files in production.

- Assumption: one screen, using the full width/height of the browser, without
  scrolling.  Our main goal is showing a nice big map with a small header and
  a sidebar.  You don't want to scroll a map.  It is of course possible to
  have a scrollbar inside that main content area itself.

- Assumption: javascript is available.  Hey, we're showing a map so you need
  javascript.  So we liberally use javascript to get the UI right, for
  instance by detecting and setting the main content area's width and height.

- Included: jquery.  Yeah, it is pretty much the standard nowadays.  So we use
  jquery where jquery can be used instead of doing it with generic javascript.

- Included: both jqueryui and jquerytools.  Visual goodies.  Jquerytools for
  the overlay and tabs, jqueryui for the rest (drag/drop and so).

- Included: openlayers as map javascript library.  (Lizard-map, sooooon to be
  released, contains our basic map interaction javascript and python code).

Django settings
---------------

Here's an excerpt of a ``settings.py`` you can use.  The media and static root
directory setup assumes the use of buildout, but you can translate it to your
own filesystem setup::

  INSTALLED_APPS = [
      'lizard_ui',
      'compressor',
      'staticfiles',
      'django.contrib.admin',
      'django.contrib.auth',
      'django.contrib.contenttypes',
      'django.contrib.sessions',
      'django.contrib.sites',
      ]

  # Note: the below settings are more elaborate than needed,
  # but we want to test django_compressor's compressing which
  # needs a media url and root and so.

  # SETTINGS_DIR allows media paths and so to be relative to
  # this settings file instead of hardcoded to
  # c:\only\on\my\computer.
  SETTINGS_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

  # BUILDOUT_DIR is for access to the "surrounding" buildout,
  # for instance for BUILDOUT_DIR/var/static files to give
  # django-staticfiles a proper place to place all collected
  # static files.
  BUILDOUT_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SETTINGS_DIR, '..'))

  # Absolute path to the directory that holds user-uploaded
  # media.
  MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'media')
  # Absolute path to the directory where django-staticfiles'
  # "bin/django build_static" places all collected static
  # files from all applications' /media directory.
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BUILDOUT_DIR, 'var', 'static')

  # URL that handles the media served from MEDIA_ROOT. Make
  # sure to use a trailing slash if there is a path component
  # (optional in other cases).
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  # URL for the per-application /media static files collected
  # by django-staticfiles.  Use it in templates like "{{
  # MEDIA_URL }}mypackage/my.css".
  STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'
  # URL prefix for admin media -- CSS, JavaScript and
  # images. Make sure to use a trailing slash.  Uses
  # STATIC_URL as django-staticfiles nicely collects admin's
  # static media into STATIC_ROOT/admin.
  ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = STATIC_URL + 'admin/'


And a suitable apache config hint::

  <Location /static_media/>
    # The css/javascript/image staticfiles are cached in the
    # browser for a day.
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 day"
  </Location>

  <Location /static_media/CACHE/>
    # django_compress's generated timestamp'ed files:
    # cache forever
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresDefault "access plus 10 years"
  </Location>

  # Static files are hosted by apache itself.
  # User-uploaded media: MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  Alias /media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/media/
  # django-staticfiles: STATIC_URL = '/static_media/'
  Alias /static_media/ ${buildout:directory}/var/static/


Upgrading to Django 1.3
-----------------------

Lizard-ui 3.0 requires Django 1.3 as we want to start using class based views
and some of the other 1.3 goodies. For that, you need to make some changes.

- Add ``LOGGING``, for instance with::

        from lizard_ui.settingshelper import setup_logging
        LOGGING = setup_logging(BUILDOUT_DIR)
        # For production, use for instance:
        # LOGGING = setup_logging(BUILDOUT_DIR, console_level=None)

- And remove any by-hand logging setup, for instance with
  ``logging.basicConfig()``.

- Import ``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` from lizard_ui, this adds a finder that also
  finds static media in /media in addition to the new /static::

        from lizard_ui.settingshelper import STATICFILES_FINDERS

- ``COMPRESS_STORAGE``, ``COMPRESS_URL`` and ``COMPRESS_ROOT`` can now be
  removed from your settings as the defaults are now fine.

- Switch from using ``bin/django build_static`` to ``bin/django
  collectstatic``.


Usage
-----

You can mount lizard-ui's urls, but it contains only live examples.  So
perhaps you should only mount it in debug mode under ``/ui``.  Handy, as it
contains reasonably full documentation on how to use it, including available
blocks and classes/IDs that you can use.

The base layout is defined in ``realbase.html``.  You should however extend
``lizard_ui/lizardbase.html`` and then override the blocks that you want.

CSS and javascript should be added to the relevant blocks, but don't forget to
call "block.super".  An example::

  {% extends "lizard_ui/lizardbase.html" %}

  {% block css %}
  {{ block.super }}
  <link type="text/css"
        href="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.css"
        media="screen, projection"
        rel="stylesheet" />
  {% endblock css %}

  {% block javascript %}
  {{ block.super }}
  <script type="text/javascript"
          src="{{ STATIC_URL }}openlayers/OpenLayers.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript"
          src="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/jquery.workspace.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript"
          src="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_map/lizard_map.js"></script>
  {% endblock javascript %}

  {% block content %}
  <div id="map"></div>
  {% endblock content %}

A example of a common task: change the logo.  For that, make a
``static/lizard_ui`` directory in your django application (or site) and place a
``logo.png`` in it.  Django-staticfiles' mechanism will take your logo.png in
preference to lizard-ui's.


Development installation
------------------------

The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
and buildout::

    $> python bootstrap.py

And then run buildout to set everything up::

    $> bin/buildout

(On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).

You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.

The current package is installed as a "development package", so
changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
setup.py develop``).

If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released
versions), add them as an "svn external" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory
and add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.

Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.


Language selector
-----------------
Starting with version 4.21 a language selector has been added to lizard-ui.
To activate the language selector for your project, put these changes in
your settings file:

- Make sure ``USE_I18N = True`` is set.

- Add ``UI_SHOW_LANGUAGE_PICKER = True``.

- Add ``'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware'`` to
  ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` just below the SessionMiddleware line and above the
  CommonMiddleware line.

- Put the available languages in the ``LANGUAGES`` settings, e.g.::

        LANGUAGES = (
            ('en', 'English'),
            ('nl', 'Nederlands'),
            ('vi', 'Viá»‡t'),
        )

- Pick a default language, e.g. ``LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'``
